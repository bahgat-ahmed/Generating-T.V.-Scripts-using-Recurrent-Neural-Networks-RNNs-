    "* First of all about the model size and architecture: I thought that having one embedding layer will be suitable for dimensionaliy reduction, and also two LSTM layers with dropout after the first LSTM layer will be good to encourage generalization through data-augmentation and avoid overfitting. Finally one fully connected layer I thought will be enough for this task. Why LSTM? because they use RNN while having long memory to detect the sequential property that exist in text.\n",
    "* A sequence length of 7 is the size of the sentences length I want to look at before generating the next word.\n",
    "* I thought that a batch_size of 130 will be suitalbe to avoid any memory issues while it is large enough for training efficiently.\n",
    "* After observing the rate of loss decrease, and the long time to generate one epoch. I thought that 20 epochs will let me reach the suitable loss below 3.5 while avoiding training for too much time.\n",
    "* The learning rate was recommended in the Hyperparameter section to be somehow in that range from 0.01 to 0.000001. When I made it 0.001 it took much time to learn, but when I changed it to 0.005 I noticed that the loss decrease didn't meet my expectation, so I kept it 0.001. I kept changing it while changing the model, but finally I observed that 0.001 will be useful in my case.\n",
    "* The higher the embedding_dim the more we will detect features in the vocab. However, the less we make it, the more dimensionality reduction we will have. I chose it to be 256, but then I have changed it to 400 has we have done in one of the notebook exercises in this module, and I noticed that the loss started from a lower value, so I thought that will be enough for reaching a fast convergence. However, after 20 epochs it took too much time and didn't reach the value below 3.5. So, I made it 270 while changing the hidden dimension to be 256.\n",
    "* The hidden dimensions was one of the parameters we had recommendations for in the Hyperparameters section. So, the instructor said that it should be in the range of 32, 64, 128, 256. So to detect more complex patterns in the data, I have chosen 256, and along with changing other parameters as I have mentioned before, all this contributed to having a decrease loss rate that was appropriate to reach a loss value less than 3.5 after 20 epochs.\n",
    "* Also the number of layers was one of the parameters we had recommendations for in the Hyperparameters section. I remember, the instructor said that (Andrej Karpathy tells us that in practice it's often the case that a three layer neural net will outperform a two layer net, but going even deeper rarely helps much more). So, I thought that 2 layers will be enough to avoid increasing the training time, since the training time already took a lot of time."
