# Generating T.V. Scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This is one of the projects I've built in Udacity **Deep Learning Nanodegree**.

## Introduction
In this project, I've generated TV scripts using Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) which is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I've used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I've built have generated a new, "fake" TV script.

## Steps taken in this project

1. Implement Pre-processing Functions.
2. Pre-processing all the data.
3. Building the Neural Network.
4. Define forward and backpropagation propagation.
5. Neural Network Training.
6. Generating fake TV Script.
